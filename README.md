This is the project repository for * insert v√•ra namn + stil-id * Martin Larsson (dat14mla), in the module EDAF90 at LTH. 

The project is to make a web application that utilises the [API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) from openlibrary. The planned features are: searching for authors, titles, genres, etc., managing lists of titles (eg. "books I have read" or "books I am want to read"), subscribing to updates to authors and titles, and to make the app a progressive web application.

The project will utilise pre-built react gui-components from https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app in accordance with the [instructions](/project.pdf) for the project.
